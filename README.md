# Java Project Machine Design


DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT

The project “SOFTWARE FOR DESIGN OF MACHINE ELEMENTS” is a standalone project will be made using java. This project is based on the machine elements like nuts, keys, shaft etc. It is a industrial and educational based project.

NEED OF THE PROJECT

•	The basic need of this project is that before in the industries we use charts for the computation of the dimensions, stress, torque etc. for the particular machine.
•	This project will remove the chart system that was in use previously.
•	This project will handle variety of products.
•	Thus if there is a new machine element given to use we can easily compute all its components with the help of this project.

FEATURES OF SOFTWARE

•	This software is versatile.
•	It is easy to handle
•	The specification of this software is based on the actual experiments.
•	This project will work as per our need. 
•	To select proper materials and best suited shapes,
•	To calculate the dimensions based on the loads on machines and strength of the material,
•	Specify the manufacturing process for the manufacture of the designed component of the machine or the whole machine.[3]	
3.6	 MODULES OF SOFTWARE
The modules of the software is explained below:-

•	MODULE-I: - In the first module the user/admin can login to access its software according to its machine elements on which he want to work. In this module he can select the elements to design like 
DESIGN OF KEYS AND SPLINES
DESIGN OF COUPLING
DESIGN OF SHAFT AND AXLES
DESIGN OF SPRINGS
DESIGN OF GEARS
DESIGN OF PRESSURE VESSELS
DESIGN OF DRIVERS

•	MODULE-II: - It will consist of the further types of the elements the user/admin choose to work on it.

•	MODULE-III: - Its will consist of the computation or calculation for the each type of the machine elements. In this module the software will pick the constant value from the database and further computation will take place.
3.7	 OBJECTIVE OF SOFTWARE
The main objective of the project is that this project can be used in the small as well the large scale industry for computation of the machine elements. The key objectives are given below:-
•	PRODUCT VARIETY: This product will handle the variety of products that are made of the machine elements.
•	PRACTICALLY: The system will be stable and can be operated with average intelligence.
•	EFFIENCY: The response would be timeliness of the system.
•	COST:  The ideal aim for system will that which have a minimum cost subject to the condition and must satisfy the entire requirement.
•	FLEXIBLE: The system would be modifiable depending on the changing needs of the user. Such modifications may be sometime leads to reconstructing. It would be also be portable to different computer systems.
•	EXPERIMENTAL: All the parameters of the software is experimental based. So, the correct computation is being carried out.

APPLICATION OF SOFTWARE

•	This project can be easily applicable in the small and the large scale industries whice use these machine elements.
•	This project is also very applicable for the every college student who had adopted MACHINE DESIGN as its subject.
